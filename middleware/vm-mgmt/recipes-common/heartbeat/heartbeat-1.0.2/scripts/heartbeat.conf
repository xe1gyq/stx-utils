## Enables/Disables the VM heartbeat server
##   "yes" == enabled
##   "no" == disabled
##   "smart" == enable only if heartbeat virtio device is present
##
HEARTBEAT_ENABLED="smart"

##################################################
## Heartbeat health check options

## This specifies the delay after initial registration to the first heartbeat in milliseconds.  This can be used
## to help deal with any delays associated with system reboots.
FIRST_HB=2000

## This specifies the interval between heartbeats in milliseconds between this heartbeat server and it's superior.
HB_INTERVAL=1000

## Set the corrective action.  Default is "log".  For a VM your options are:
##   "log"     Only a log is issued to syslog's 'user' facility on the compute.
##             e.g. /var/log/user.log on Titanium's sample guest image
##             e.g. /var/log/messages on many common distributions
##   "reboot"  Issue a nova reboot against this instance.  
##             Also a log is sent to syslog's 'user' facility on the compute.
##             e.g. /var/log/user.log on Titanium's sample guest image
##             e.g. /var/log/messages on many common distributions
##   "stop"    Issue a nova stop against this instance.
##   "script"  Run a script on the compute.  See CORRECTIVE_SCRIPT below.  For trusted VM's only.
##             The mechanism to restrict this will be added in future.
CORRECTIVE_ACTION="reboot"

## An arguement to be made available to CORRECTIVE_SCRIPT below.
CORRECTIVE_VAR=0

## Path to corrective action script on compute.  Only used if CORRECTIVE_ACTION="script"
## The following environment variables will be present when the script is run.
##     INSTANCE_ID, CORRECTIVE_ACTION_VAR, INSTANCE_PID, INSTANCE_NAME
CORRECTIVE_SCRIPT=""

## Heartbeat event notification and voting options

## The overall time to vote in milliseconds reguardless of the event 
## being voted upon.  It should reflect the slowest of all expected 
## voters when in a sane and healthy condition, plus some allowance 
## for scheduling and messaging
VOTE=8000

## The overall time to handle a stop or reboot notification in milliseconds.
## It should reflect the slowest of all expected notification handlers
## when in a sane and healthy condition, plus some allowance for scheduling
## and messaging
SHUTDOWN_NOTICE=8000

## The overall time to handle a pause, suspend or migrate begin notification
## in milliseconds.  It should reflect the slowest of all expected notification
## handlers when in a sane and healthy condition, plus some allowance for
## scheduling and messaging
SUSPEND_NOTICE=8000

## The overall time to handle an unpause, resume or migrate end notification 
## in milliseconds.  It should reflect the slowest of all expected notification
## handlers when in a sane and healthy condition, plus some allowance for 
## scheduling and messaging.  It does not include reboot time.
RESUME_NOTICE=13000

## The overall time to handle a heat downscale notification in milliseconds.
## It should reflect the slowest handling expected for this event
## when in a sane and healthy condition, plus some allowance for scheduling
## and messaging
DOWNSCALE_NOTICE=9000

## The overall time to reboot, up to the point of heartbeat server start,
## in milliseconds.  Allow for some I/O contention.
RESTART=300000

## The Path to the event notification script. This is optional.  
## The script will be called when nova initiates an action that
## will impact the vm
##
## The event handling script is invoked with two parameters:
##
##   my_event_handling_script MSGTYPE EVENT
##
##     MSGTYPE is one of:
##       'revocable'    Indicating a vote is called for.  Return zero to accept, non-zero to reject.
##                      For a rejection, the first line of stdout emitted by the script will be captured
##                      and passed up to Nova as well is various heartbeat and nova log indicating why
##                      the event was rejected.
##
##       'irrevocable'  Indicating this is a notification only. Take prepatory actions and return zero
##                      if successful, or non-zero on failure.  In the case if failure the first line of
##                      stdout emitted by the script will be captured made visible in a heartbeat log.
##                      Otherwise the return code has no effect on behaviour.
##
##     EVENT is on of: ( 'stop',  'reboot',  'pause', 'unpause', 'suspend', 'resume', 'downscale',
##                       'live_migrate_begin', 'live_migrate_end', 'cold_migrate_begin', 'cold_migrate_end' )
